  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  #offset:
  # x: 0
  #  y: 0
  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  use_thin_strokes: true

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Possible values for `animation`
# `Ease`
# `EaseOut`
# `EaseOutSine`
# `EaseOutQuad`
# `EaseOutCubic`
